<h1 align="center">Compiling from source</h1>

Stenguage is made in C# so you will need to use Visual Studio to compile it.

First clone the GitHub repo and open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
```console
git clone https://github.com/sten-code/Stenguage.git
```

Click on `Build > Build Solution` in order to compile Stenguage.
The `StdLib` should automatically be compiled and added to the `libs` folder of Stenguage.

You can add the folder to your environment variables in order to use the `stenguage` command everywhere.
